My name is Dexter. Dexter Morgan. I don't know what made me the way I am, but, whatever it was left a hollow place inside. People fake a lot of human interactions but I feel like I fake them all very well. That's my burden, I guess. But I will not blame my foster parents; Henry and Doris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me... But they're both dead now... I didn't kill them. Honest
